# NLP_password_strength

The goal of this project is to analyze the strength of passwords and predict their robustness against potential security threats. This involves understanding the characteristics of strong versus weak passwords and applying machine learning models to classify them effectively.

Resources
- Datasets: Password databases with labeled strength levels.
- Tools: SQL for database management, Python for data processing and machine learning.
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, TF-IDF from Scikit-learn, etc.

Key Features:

- Data Integration: Leveraged SQL to efficiently manage and retrieve password datasets from various sources.
- Data Cleaning: Implemented robust data cleaning techniques to ensure high-quality and consistent data for analysis.
- Semantic Analysis: Performed in-depth semantic analysis to understand the linguistic patterns within passwords.
- Feature Engineering: Engineered meaningful features from the password data, enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.
- TF-IDF Application: Applied Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to transform text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
- Machine Learning Models: Utilized logistic regression and other classification algorithms to predict password strength.
- Model Evaluation: Conducted thorough model evaluation using accuracy metrics to assess performance and ensure reliability.

The project successfully classifies the strength of passwords using various NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting password strength.
