# NLP_password_strength

The goal of this project is to analyze the strength of passwords and predict their robustness against potential security threats. This involves understanding the characteristics of strong versus weak passwords and applying machine learning models to classify them effectively.

Resources
- Datasets: Password databases with labeled strength levels.
- Tools: SQL for database management, Python for data processing and machine learning.
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, TF-IDF from Scikit-learn, etc.

The project successfully classifies the strength of passwords using various NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting password strength.
